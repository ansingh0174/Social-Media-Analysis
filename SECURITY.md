## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately disclose** the issue by emailing us at [ansingh0174@gmail.com](mailto:ansingh0174@gmail.com). Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

2. Include **detailed information** about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce if possible. The more details you provide, the easier it is for us to validate and respond to your report.

3. We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and strive to provide regular updates on the progress of any fix.

4. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work diligently to **assess and validate** the issue.

5. **Public disclosure** of the vulnerability will occur after a fix has been fully deployed and made available to all affected versions.
